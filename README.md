## MatLab, SimuLink and Python code ##

This repository contains code for the House Models used in  HAN CSE projects.

Let's try to keep files organised in a clear directory structure as much as possible, anticipating the growth
of the number of code and data files.  Currently, we have (planned):

* Simple model/		- MatLaband SimuLink grey box model.

Please do NOT use SPACES or EXOTIC SYMBOLS in file and directory names.  Let's stick to `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and `.-_`.
